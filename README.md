# SimplyNote

As a singer-songwriter, I haven't found a notes/writing app that gives me the functionality and simplicity that I want without being
bloated with non-essential features. This app is the first version in my idea of a notes app that is centered around singer-songwriters. 
There are more functionalities I want to add in that will simplify the songwriting process. This was built using Angular7 and uses local 
storage to automatically save your notes as you type. Let me know what you think!
